# What's the deal with Nix and BEAM languages

<sup>All the links below are also mirrored on archive.org</sup>

Only  used  Nix   as  a  scaffold  to   set  up  the
interpreters with the right versions, and in Phoenix
projects,  to get  PostgreSQL in  line. Never  tried
BEAM  package managment  with  Nix thougt  as it  is
really confusing and may not even work based on what
I read on the links  below. The [Nix manual entry for
BEAM languages](https://nixos.org/nixpkgs/manual/#sec-beam)
is also not very  helpful; most of the scripts I use
have  been scraped together from other sources.
